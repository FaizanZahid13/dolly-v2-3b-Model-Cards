# dolly-v2-3b-Model-Cards

Databricks' dolly-v2-3b is a large language model trained on the Databricks machine learning platform, designed to follow instructions. 
It is specifically developed for commercial use and is based on pythia-2.8b. 
Dolly is trained on a dataset called databricks-dolly-15k, which consists of approximately 15,000 instruction/response pairs. These pairs were generated by Databricks employees and cover various capability domains discussed in the InstructGPT paper, such as brainstorming, classification, closed QA, generation, information extraction, open QA, and summarization. 
Although dolly-v2-3b may not be the most advanced model available, it displays remarkably accurate instruction-following behavior that surpasses the performance of the base model it is built upon.
